// This lists all the people, sites or projects who made their code available or helped me to be a better coder.
// I may have missed a credit, so if I did, this was not meant as an insult to you. Sometimes you find code and cannot find it again, we have all been there.

// MultiWii Project - http://www.multiwii.com/ - I learn't much about coding for the sensors from this project. 
// Well worth getting involved with this project if you want to get familiar with more complex Arduino coding.

// Tau Labs Project - http://taulabs.org/ - The group of people who made my dream of being involved with autopilots possible. 
// This is the place I frequent for all my autopilot hobby stuff. Thanks Guys/Girls (I think we have girl members).

// Openpilot project - http://www.openpilot.org/ - UAVTalk

// Minimoposd http://code.google.com/p/minoposd/ - For UAVTalk implementation on Arduino

// http://arduino.cc/forum/index.php?topic=58048.0. IMU Explanation

// http://www.starlino.com/imu_guide.html - want to understand IMUs, read this. Its explained as simply as possible.

// http://tchester.org/sgm/analysis/peaks/how_to_get_view_params.html - Forumula for Azimuth and Elevation - get explanation of how the math works and real world examples.



// Places that taught me how to code and other coding tips.

// http://www.sparkfun.com Sparkfun product pages - love the discussions and example code, they taught me heaps.

// https://www.arduino.cc - Thanks for being so helpful with all the posters. Never posted myself, but I am a lurker for sure.

// All the blogs out there for beginner coders. THANK YOU for taking to time to help those less experienced than you.

// NOTE: Try to get away from using libraries as soon as you have got a few results. Libraries are great for getting initial
// results but will hinder your understanding of how sensors and the math involved work.
