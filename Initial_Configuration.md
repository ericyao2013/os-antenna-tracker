# Introduction #

Initial configuration required.

# Details #

Currently the only hardware supported is the HobbyKing MultiWii Pro with MTK GPS. I chose this because its the cheapest/simplest option but the software could be expanded to support other boards.

You need to setup the sensors on the tracker hardware. Setup is usually a one time requirement.
  1. Calibrate the Magnetometer
  1. Set Level point
  1. Setup Servo Min and Max PWM values
  1. Setup your telemetry options

Magnetometer calibration may need to be done at regular intervals if you are moving your board between a Pan/Tilt head made from wood to metal.
